# Dependences for proper works

Simply open your terminal and in the same folder, type `chmod +x ./install.sh && ./install.sh` to install all dependencies and move the tools to their respective folder.

Or, if you prefer, you can do it manually:


***First step***: you need install brew [https://brew.sh/]
***Second step***: 
For Videos
```shell
brew install ffmpeg ffmpeg2theora
```

Images
```shell
brew install imagemagick
```

Images AVIF
```shell
brew install joedrago/repo/avifenc
```

Clone the repository


Copy all the contents of the `workflow` folder to `/Users/<USER>/Library/Services/`


As they are installed, we make secondary click on some image or file, in the submenu we go to quick or service actions > Customize.


It will open extensions of the System Setup, with the options copied previously, we give to check in those that we want and already we can use them.
